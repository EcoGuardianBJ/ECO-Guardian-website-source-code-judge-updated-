<!-- FAQ SECTION START -->

<button class="accordion">1. What is the SmartLeaf Health Detector?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>SmartLeaf is an AI-powered system that uses the HuskyLens camera to analyze leaf images and detect signs of disease, stress, or nutrient deficiency.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">2. How does SmartLeaf detect leaf health?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The HuskyLens captures a leaf image and sends it into an AI model. The AI checks colour, texture, patterns, and disease-like spots to determine the leaf’s condition.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">3. What hardware does SmartLeaf use?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>SmartLeaf currently uses HuskyLens for image detection and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to process the data and send the results to a Telegram bot using WiFi.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">4. What does the Raspberry Pi do?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The Raspberry Pi works as the communication brain. It receives detection results, processes them, and sends real-time notifications to Telegram.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">5. Why use AI instead of human observation?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>AI can detect tiny changes that humans usually miss, especially at early stages of disease. This helps with faster action and reduces tree loss.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">6. What is the main purpose of SmartLeaf?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>SmartLeaf aims to assist farmers, environmental officers, PERHILITAN, and students by offering a fast and reliable AI-driven plant health diagnosis tool.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">7. Can I buy SmartLeaf?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes! SmartLeaf will be available soon as both a fully assembled product and a DIY educational kit.  
  <br><br><b>You can purchase it directly from our team.</b></p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">8. Where can I get the components?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You can purchase the full SmartLeaf kit directly from us. Individual components will also be available through our official order form.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">9. Can SmartLeaf be customized for farms or plantations?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. We offer customized AI models, multiple device deployment, and integration with farm monitoring dashboards upon request.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">10. Is SmartLeaf suitable for school projects?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Absolutely. SmartLeaf is designed as an educational-friendly kit for Biology, Geography, STEM, and AI learning activities.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">11. Does SmartLeaf need internet?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>SmartLeaf only needs WiFi if you want to send results to Telegram. The AI detection itself works offline.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">12. Can it run in the forest?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. SmartLeaf is portable and can operate offline. If there's no WiFi, results will be stored locally and uploaded later.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">13. Will more sensors be added in the future?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Yes. The next version may include temperature, humidity, air quality, and soil sensors for more accurate plant health analytics.</p>
</div>
